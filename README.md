# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When interpretting user needs, it's best to record who is making the request, why they are making it, and what will be accomplished by solving their problem.  This will make it easier to identify exactly what the need is, and the best way to fix it.  For example, if we recieved a user story that requested that we make adjustments to the chat-box part of our system, our changes might differ if the request came from a customer rather than an employee at the company that users the chat-box.  Combining all of this information into a "user story" ensures that we solve the problem as completely and correctly as possible.  

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Though this is dependent on the size of the program, it's generally best to begin by making a plan of what the program should be able to do, how it should be used, etc.  Agile methodologies remind us that these plans could change at any time, but it's good to have a general goal before code is written.  

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member entirely revolves around good communication.  This involves honesty and openness above all else.  Each member of the team should feel welcome to share his/her opinions about the project, as well as describe anywhere where they are having issues.  At the same time, a good team member is open to hearing other people's opinions, as well as not judging people when they encounter issues.  All of this combined will make for an excellent team member.
